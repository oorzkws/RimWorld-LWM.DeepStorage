     * Verse/AI/Toils_Haul.cs: Toil PlaceHauledThingInCell(...)   
     * 
     * We want to add a wait while the pawn puts things into Deep Storage,
     *   so we patch the PlaceHauledThingInCell toil to add the wait.
     * 
     * The way the jobdriver and toils for hauling are set up, when
     * PlaceHauledThingInCell(...) is called to create the Toil, we
     * can't actually tell if the Thing is being carried to Deep Storage.
     * Annoying.  So we create a PreInitAction for the Toil that checks!
     * 
     * If we aren't going into DeepStorage, the initAction happens
     *   instantly, no ticks happen in waiting, and the entire
     *   placement happens at once.
     *
     * We always take the old initAction (placeStuff below), which 
     *   does the actual placing, and set it to always happen on 
     *   ticksRemaining==1.
     *   We do this regardless of the test in InitActon for whether
     *   we are going into DeepStorage
     *   Why?  Saved games.  InitAction may not get called if
     *   we are already in the middle of the toil when the game
     *   was saved.  But we still need to put down the stuff.
     * 
     * We change the initAction to do a test for DeepStorage.
     *   If is IS, it sets up the waiting.
     *  -remove the original initAction (still going to happen on tick 1)
     *       (placeStuff)
     *  -add progress bar (doesn't happen on load, btw)
     *   (could change if it's ever important)
     *  -counts ticks, etc.
     *   If it ISN'T, it just calls the original placeAction.
     * Also done, setting up fail conditions.    
     *   (still some TODO)
     * 
     * NOTE: Better approach might be to patch the toil creation  \
     * (not  in the JobDriver_HaulToCell, but that would involve   --- Probably not - not all mods use the same job
     * true) Transpiler editing of an IEnumerable jump table.     /
     *
