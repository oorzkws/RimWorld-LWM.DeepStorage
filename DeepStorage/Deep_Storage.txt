    /// Deep Storage:
    /// 
    /// So many things need to be added or patched to allow more than one object 
    ///    in Deep Storage units:
    /// 1. Deep_Storage.cs:
    ///    Adds CompProperties LWM.DeepStorage.Properties
    ///      and assosciated ThingComp CompDeepStorage
    ///    also some utility functions
    /// 2. Deep_Storage_CanCarryItemsTo.cs
    ///    Patches RimWorld.StoreUtility's NoStorageBlockersIn - no longer block
    ///    if the storage unit isn't full yet
    ///    Also, disallow pets from hauling to Deep Storage Units
    /// 3. Deep_Storage_Jobs.cs
    ///    Verse.AI.HaulAIUtility's HaulToCellStorageJob - let pawns know how many
    ///    of stackable things (e.g., wood) they can carry to deep storage
    /// 4. Deep_Storage_Pause.cs
    ///    Verse/AI/Toils_Haul.cs's Toil PlaceHauledThingInCell(...) - 
    ///    change the toil to having a bit of a wait while putting into a DSU
    /// 5. Deep_Storage_PutInto.cs
    ///    Verse.GenPlace's TryPlaceDirect - allow putting down stuff
    ///      in deep storage, even if there's already stuff there.
    ///      also, tidy up stackable stuff
    ///    Verse.GenSpawn's Spawn - allow putting 2 or more items in the same place
    /// 6. Deep_Storage_TakeFrom.cs
    ///    Verse.Ai.Toil_Haul's StartCarryThing - the delegate() function, so
    ///    Pawns picking up 50 of something from Deep Storage pick up more than
    ///    just the 7 in the top stack. (otherwise, they have reserved the spot
    ///    so can't get anything else lying there)
    /// 7. Deep_Storage_SaveLoad.cs
    ///    And then there is the loading, which requires 3 more patches to make sure
    ///    items can spawn on top of each other...and not pretty patches.  Why?  B/c
    ///    buildings spawn after items do...so checking if an item is in DeepStorage
    ///    isn't possible during game load. TODO: Bug still exists here
    /// 8. Deep_Storage_UI.cs
    ///    Because no one wants to click 9 times to finally select the building.
    /// 9. ModCompatibility.cs
    ///    Makes Deep Storage play well with:
    ///      RimWorld Search Agency (Hauling Hysteresis)
